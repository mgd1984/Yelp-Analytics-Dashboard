# Yelp-Analytics-Dashboard

This repository contains all of the R markdown code, data, and links necessary to reproduce an analytics dashboard created using Yelp's Academic Data Set and the Yelp Data Challenge (https://drill.apache.org/docs/analyzing-the-yelp-academic-dataset/).  

In addition to the R markdown code, you must have Apache Drill installed and running in order for the code to run properly.  

For a quick-start guide on Apache Drill, see https://drill.apache.org/docs/drill-in-10-minutes/
